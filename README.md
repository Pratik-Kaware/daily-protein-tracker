## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8+
- 16GB RAM (32GB recommended)
- 8GB GPU memory (16GB recommended)
- 50GB free storage

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/indian-nutrition-tracker.git
cd indian-nutrition-tracker
```

2. **Setup environment**
```bash
# Create conda environment
conda env create -f environment.yml
conda activate nutrition-tracker

# Or use pip
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. **Download base LLama model**
```bash
python scripts/download_models.py
```

4. **Setup nutrition database**
```bash
python scripts/setup_environment.sh
```

5. **Launch Jupyter Lab**
```bash
jupyter lab
```

6. **Start with the demo notebook**
Open `notebooks/04_nutrition_analysis.ipynb` and start tracking!

## 📖 Usage Examples

### Basic Nutrition Query
```python
# In Jupyter notebook
nutritionist = NutritionistLLM()

query = "I had 10 eggs for breakfast. How much protein?"
response = nutritionist.analyze(query)
print(response)
```

**Output:**
```
🥚 10 eggs provide:
• Protein: 60g (excellent for muscle building!)
• Calories: 700
• Fat: 50g
• Carbs: 6g

💡 Pro tip: That's a lot of protein at once! Consider spacing throughout the day for better absorption.
```

### Complex Indian Meal Analysis
```python
query = """
Lunch today:
- 4 rotis
- 1 cup moong dal
- 1 portion rice
- Mixed vegetables
How's my macro breakdown?
"""

response = nutritionist.analyze(query)
```

**Output:**
```
🍛 Your lunch breakdown:
• 4 rotis: 12.4g protein, 60.8g carbs
• 1 cup moong dal: 14.2g protein, 39g carbs  
• 1 portion rice: 4.3g protein, 45g carbs
• Mixed vegetables: 3g protein, 12g carbs

📊 Total: 33.9g protein, 156.8g carbs, 4.2g fat
⚡ Calories: ~680

🎯 Verdict: Great balanced meal! Perfect post-workout combination.
```

## 🔧 Fine-tuning Your Nutritionist

### 1. Prepare Your Data
```bash
# Add your custom Indian foods to the database
python src/data_processing/csv_processor.py --add-foods custom_foods.csv
```

### 2. Generate Training Conversations
```bash
# Create conversation-style training data
python src/data_processing/training_data_generator.py
```

### 3. Fine-tune the Model
```python
# In notebooks/02_model_fine_tuning.ipynb
from src.model.fine_tuning import NutritionistTrainer

trainer = NutritionistTrainer(
    base_model="llama3.1-8b-instruct",
    temperature=0.8,
    training_data="data/processed/training_data.jsonl"
)

trainer.fine_tune()
```
